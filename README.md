Create image copies with square dimensions to interface more cleanly with web layouts.

Image copies may fill background with either a solid color (default: white) or a computed average based on the edge of the original image.

### Work in progress
ChangeRose should be a robust image size editor. The default functionality is to produce a square image from an input image, but it should be able to handle various types of background color prescriptions and size (or aspect ratio) specifications.
